        laws prohibit those restrictions or you have our written permission.

        <h3>Modifying and Terminating Our Services</h3>
        We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a Service to, for

        terms regularly. We'll post notice of modifications to these terms on this page. Changes
        will not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner than fourteen days
        after they are posted. However, changes addressing new functions for a Service or
        changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to the
        modified terms for a Service, you should discontinue your use of the Service.

        will control for that conflict.
