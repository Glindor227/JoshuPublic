        <h3>Information Joshu Collects</h3>
        <h4>Your activity & apps</h4>
        At the time you register for Joshu, you voluntarily give us information such as your name
        and email address. You have the access and can update this information under your personal
        Account Settings at any time. We also collect aggregated, anonymous user data about the use
        of the app.

        <h4>Your browsers & devices</h4>
        We collect information about the browsers and devices you use to access Joshu. The user data
        we collect is used to enhance Joshu and the quality of our service. We only collect personal
        data required to deliver our services, and we only store it to the extent that it is
        essential to perform these services.

        <h3>Why Joshu Collects Data</h3>
        We use data to build better services. Your information will not be shared with others and
        will only be used internally for the purposes described below:

        <h4>Provide our services</h4>
        We use your information to deliver our services or information you requested, and to process
        and complete any transactions.

        <h4>Maintain & improve our services</h4>
        We also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as
        tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your
        information to make improvements to our services - for example, to analyze usage and trends
        with anonymous user data, and to improve the quality of our service and user experience.

        <h4>Communicate with you</h4>
        Joshu collects email addresses from those who communicate with us via email, as well as
        information provided through voluntary activities such as site registration or survey
        participation. We use the information we collect to interact with you directly.

        <h4>Protect Joshu, our users, and the public</h4>
        We use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes
        detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues
        that could harm Joshu, our users, or the public.

        <p>We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We'll ask for
        your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn't covered in this Privacy
        Policy.

        You're also welcome to
        <a href="mailto:joshu.appinfo@gmail.com">contact us</a>
        to ask for our confirmation whenever you feel concerned
        about how your personal information is being processed, where and for what purpose.

        <h3>Your Privacy Controls</h3>
        While Joshu owns the Joshu application's code, databases, and all rights, you retain all
        rights to your data. You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's
        used. Joshu will never sell your personal data with a third party, and we will never share
        data to third parties without your permission. When absolutely necessary, Joshu uses third
        party services and hosting partners who are GDPR-compliant. In such instances, we take
        essential security methods to guarantee that we comply with GDPR when sending and receiving
        data from third parties.

        <h3>Cookies</h3>
        Cookies are required on Joshu's Website. We use them to collect visitors' preferences and
        thus to better optimize the user experience. Users can disable cookies in their browser
        settings. But please note that our services rely on cookies to function properly, and you
        may not be able to access certain features on our Website after disabling them.

        <h3>Keeping Your Information Secure</h3>
        Joshu is built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. SSL
        protocol secures all data and information transmitted with Service. The insights we gain
        from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from
        ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about,
        we'll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.

        <p>We work hard to protect you and Joshu from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or
        destruction of information we hold. You can learn more about our security measures from the
        Security page.

        <h3>Changes to This Policy</h3>
        If our Privacy Policy changes at some time in the future, we will not reduce your rights
        under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. We always indicate the date the
        latest changes were published. If changes are significant, we'll provide a more prominent
        notice (including, for certain services, email notification of Privacy Policy changes).

        <p>Please check back periodically to keep informed of updates or changes to this Privacy
        Policy. By continuing to access and to use Joshu, you are agreeing to be bound by the
        revised policy.
